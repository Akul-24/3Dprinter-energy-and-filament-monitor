# 3Dprinter_energy-and-filament-monitor

This is first version of OmnisPrint repo that includes just arduino code and mobile app.
Arduino code and mobile app are still work in progress so some functions do not work yet and there may be few minor bugs.

I'm currently working on new version and I'll add new code, pcb and 3D design files once it's finished.
