Here are some esp32 pin connections used in code (you can change them as you like)

Voltage divider: G34
Current: G32  (connected to acs712 output trough 5v to 3.3v voltage divider)
Relay: G16  (connected trough transistor - pn2222 in my case)
Addressable LED strip: G33
Buzzer: G22
Rotary encoder: G26, G25
Switch (button): G27
Screen backlight: G5
Filament encoder: G17, G4
Filament runout sensor: G35
