App made using Mit app inventor to remotely control everything.
Mobile phone and OmnisPrint need to be connected to same network (local), its own acces point or trough google firebase.
To connect to the network for the first time you'll need to connect your phone to "OmnisPrint" access point (by opening wifi/network on it),
choose one of the found networks and send password to it trough app network menu.

Filament settings part of the app does not work yet and there are some smaller bugs.
